    <p>
        Cook a traditional Jamaican dish, ackee and salted cod, for a hearty brunch.
    <br>
        With peppers, tomato and garlic alongside the ackee fruit, it's full of flavour!
    <br>
    <br>
    Ackee and Saltfish is Jamaica's national dish.
    <br>
     Ackee is a fatty fruit that must be picked only when ripe, and then properly cleaned by someone who knows what they are doing.
    <br>
     Saltfish is salted cod. It’s usually paired with all sorts of side dishes. Anything from boiled dumplings, roast breadfruit and boiled banana
    <br>
     to fried dumplings, callaloo and fried breadfruit are great side dishes.

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>600g boneless salted cod</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>3 spring onions</li>
        <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground pimento</li>
        <li>½ red pepper</li>
        <li>½ green pepper</li>
        <li>1 large tomato</li>
        <li>2 x 540g cans ackee</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Put the salt cold in your pot and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then boil for 5 minutes, drain and add fresh cold water to cover./li>
        <li>Repeat this process until you're happy with the saltiness when tasted; we recommend to boil the fish three times in total for a perfect balance of salt in the fish. Drain and leave to cool. Use a fork to shred the salted cod into pieces and set aside.</li>
        <li>Now you'll need a large frying pan. Pour the vegetable oil into the frying pan and place over a high heat. Once the oil is sizzling hot, turn the heat down to low-medium. Add the onion, garlic, spring onions and scotch bonnet, then cook until soft, for around 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the salted cod, dash in some black pepper, thyme and pimento, then mix it together and cook down for around 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, add in the red and green bell peppers, along with your tomato. Mix together and cook down for 2-3 minutes. These ingredients help to bring a heat balance, so it's not too spicy.</li>
        <li>Now you'll need to add in your ackee and dash in a little more black pepper. Fold in the ackee; the ackee is soft so it's important to fold it in very gently – nobody likes mushy ackee.</li>
        
    </ol>
