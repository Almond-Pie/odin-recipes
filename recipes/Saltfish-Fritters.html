    <p>
        Jamaicans have a deep-rooted tradition of eating salted fish, which has become an integral part of our culinary heritage.
        <br>
        The tradition of salting fish dates back to a time before freezers and refrigerators,
        <br>
        when preserving fish with salt was a practical way to ensure a stable food supply during long sea voyages.
        <br>
        The practice continues today, and salted fish has become an essential ingredient in various Jamaican dishes, including saltfish fritters.
